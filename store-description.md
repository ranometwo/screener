# **EvenTrade: The Missing Bridge for Screener.in**

**Stop switching tabs. Start trading smarter.**

If you use **Screener.in** for fundamental research and **TradingView** for technical charts, you know the pain: copying tickers, opening new tabs, searching for symbols, and losing track of which stocks you've already looked at.

**EvenTrade** fixes this. It seamlessly connects your favorite research tool with your favorite charting tool, letting you build watchlists and open charts without ever slowing down.

### **Why You Need This?**

📉 **One-Click Charts (No More Copy-Pasting)**
Every time you see a list of stocks on Screener (like search results or a "Saved Screen"), EvenTrade adds a small blue button next to the name.

* **Click it:** Instantly opens the **TradingView** chart for that stock in a new tab.
* **Track Progress:** The button turns purple after you click it, so you never waste time checking the same chart twice.
* **Smart:** It even works for complex BSE codes—we find the correct symbol for you automatically.

📝 **Your Personal Research Sidebar**
Stop scribbling tickers on sticky notes. EvenTrade adds a clean, slide-out sidebar to the right side of Screener.in.

* **Instant Add:** See a stock you like? Click the **`+`** icon in the table, and it flies straight into your sidebar watchlist.
* **Multiple Lists:** Create separate lists for "Breakout Ideas," "Long Term Bets," or "Penny Stocks."
* **Stay Focused:** Your watchlist stays visible while you browse different pages on Screener.

🚦 **Prioritize with "Traffic Lights"**
Not all stocks are ready to buy *right now*. In your sidebar, click the colored bar next to any stock to tag it:

* 🔴 **Red:** "Wait / Watch for dip"
* 🟡 **Yellow:** "Near Entry"
* 🟢 **Green:** "Ready to Buy"

⚡ **Bulk Capture (The "Scan" Button)**
Found a great screen with 50 results? Don't add them one by one.

* Click **"Scan Page"** to instantly grab every stock visible on your screen.
* Click **"Scan All"** to automatically grab results from *all* pages (e.g., page 1 to 50) and dump them into a specific watchlist for later review.

### **How It Works (In 3 Steps)**

1. **Install:** Add to Chrome and go to Screener.in.
2. **Browse:** You will immediately see new **`+`** and **`Chart`** buttons on every table row.
3. **Organize:** Open the sidebar (click the extension icon) to manage your lists, change colors, or export your data to Excel.

### **Privacy Promise**

**Your data is yours.**
EvenTrade stores your watchlists directly in your browser (Chrome Sync). We do not have servers, we do not track your trades, and we never see your data.
