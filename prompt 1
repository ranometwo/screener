1. Purpose

EvenTrade is a Chrome extension sidebar for Screener.in that enables users to:

Organize stocks into persistent watchlists

Quickly open charts and track priorities

Extract and reuse symbols from Screener pages

Work efficiently without leaving Screener

The goal is to reduce friction between screening → organizing → acting.

2. In Scope

Create, rename, delete watchlists

Persist watchlists across sessions and tabs

View all watchlists (home view)

Open individual watchlist (detail view)

2.3 Symbol Management

Add symbols to watchlists:

From scanner results

Manually (EXCHANGE:SYMBOL)

Remove symbols from watchlists

Deduplicate symbols automatically

2.4 Symbol Actions

Open Screener chart (SC) in new tab

Open TradingView chart (TV) in new tab

Bookmark symbols with a single color:

Red / Yellow / Green

2.5 Filtering

Filter symbols within a watchlist by bookmark color

Filters apply only to the active watchlist

2.6 Symbol Scanner

Save scanned symbols as a watchlist

2.7 Settings

Authentication or backend services

4. Functional Requirements
FR-1 Sidebar Behavior

FR-3 Symbol Rows

Each symbol supports:

Bookmark color (one at a time)

Last-opened symbol is visually highlighted

FR-4 Symbol Scanner

5. Non-Functional Requirements

8. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Screener DOM changes	Use resilient selectors and graceful fallback
Storage quota limits	Provide CSV export/import
Sidebar performance	Lazy-load scanner and settings
9. Assumptions

Screener.in markup provides company links

TradingView URLs can be generated client-side

Users are Chrome-based
